# Notes
# I don't know how to make strings in PowerFX, so comments will do for now

# Project language file 1
# For: seanpm2001/Learn-PowerFX
# About:
# I decided to make PowerFX the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-PowerFX) as PowerFX is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the PowerFX programming language. It only makes sense to make PowerFX the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
